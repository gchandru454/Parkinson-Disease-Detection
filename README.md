# Parkinson-Disease-Detection
The Parkinson’s disease is progressive neuro degenerative disorder that affects a lot 
only people significantly affecting their quality of life. It mostly affect the motor 
functions of human. The main motor symptoms are called "parkinsonism" or 
"parkinsonian syndrome". 
# About
Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects movement. It occurs when certain nerve cells (neurons) in the brain gradually break down or die. These neurons produce dopamine, a chemical messenger that plays a crucial role in controlling movement and coordination. When dopamine levels drop, it leads to the symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease.

# Features
Introduction to Parkinson's Disease: Provide an overview of what Parkinson's disease is, including its symptoms, causes, and prevalence.

Epidemiology and Risk Factors: Explore the demographics affected by Parkinson's disease, including age, gender, and geographical distribution. Discuss potential risk factors such as genetics, environmental exposures, and lifestyle factors.

Pathophysiology: Describe the underlying biological mechanisms involved in Parkinson's disease, focusing on the loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain and the formation of Lewy bodies.
# Requirements
Research: Conduct thorough research to gather up-to-date information on Parkinson's disease, including its epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment options, and recent advancements in research.

Content Structure: Develop a clear and organized structure for the project, dividing it into sections or chapters based on different aspects of Parkinson's disease (e.g., introduction, epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment, research).

Accuracy and Reliability: Ensure that all information presented in the project is accurate, reliable, and based on reputable sources such as peer-reviewed journals, textbooks, and official medical websites or organizations.

Clarity and Accessibility: Use language that is clear and accessible to a diverse audience, avoiding jargon whenever possible. Include explanations and definitions for technical terms to enhance understanding.

# Results and Impact
The project aims to increase awareness and understanding of Parkinson's disease among both the general public and healthcare professionals. By providing comprehensive information on the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment options for Parkinson's disease, the project seeks to empower individuals affected by the condition to make informed decisions about their healthcare. Additionally, by highlighting recent advancements in research and treatment modalities, the project aims to inspire further innovation in the field and foster collaboration among researchers, clinicians, and advocacy groups.
