# Parkinson-Disease-Detection
The Parkinsonâ€™s disease is progressive neuro degenerative disorder that affects a lot 
only people significantly affecting their quality of life. It mostly affect the motor 
functions of human. The main motor symptoms are called "parkinsonism" or 
"parkinsonian syndrome". 
# About
Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects movement. It occurs when certain nerve cells (neurons) in the brain gradually break down or die. These neurons produce dopamine, a chemical messenger that plays a crucial role in controlling movement and coordination. When dopamine levels drop, it leads to the symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease.

# Features
Introduction to Parkinson's Disease: Provide an overview of what Parkinson's disease is, including its symptoms, causes, and prevalence.

Epidemiology and Risk Factors: Explore the demographics affected by Parkinson's disease, including age, gender, and geographical distribution. Discuss potential risk factors such as genetics, environmental exposures, and lifestyle factors.

Pathophysiology: Describe the underlying biological mechanisms involved in Parkinson's disease, focusing on the loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain and the formation of Lewy bodies.
# Requirements
Research: Conduct thorough research to gather up-to-date information on Parkinson's disease, including its epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment options, and recent advancements in research.

Content Structure: Develop a clear and organized structure for the project, dividing it into sections or chapters based on different aspects of Parkinson's disease (e.g., introduction, epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment, research).

Accuracy and Reliability: Ensure that all information presented in the project is accurate, reliable, and based on reputable sources such as peer-reviewed journals, textbooks, and official medical websites or organizations.

Clarity and Accessibility: Use language that is clear and accessible to a diverse audience, avoiding jargon whenever possible. Include explanations and definitions for technical terms to enhance understanding.
